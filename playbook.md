**Want to Go Deeper? Learn what motivates people to vote:**

* **Make it social** - People vote when they hear that turnout is expected to be high. Help people share that they've voted.
* **Plan the trip** - People who make concrete plans ahead of time (when, where, with whom, what to bring) are more likely to vote.
* **Make it personal** - People who expect friends or acquaintances to hold them accountable for voting are more likely to vote.
* **Invoke civic responsibility** - People care about their civic duty and like identifying as a "voter."
* **Make it easier** - People vote when it's easy. Show people polling locations, transportation options, and friends making the trip.
* **Remind them -** People vote when they remember it's important and they have a limited time to get it done.

*Design Your Own Features*
**Key Election Milestones: What to ask people to do:**

* **Register** by mid-October
    * Most registration deadlines are ~10/8.  
    * Example: *"Your voter registration deadline is coming up. _Confirm your status_ in 30 seconds."*
* **Vote early**
    * 36 states offer early voting by mail or in person.  35% of 2012 votes were early.
    * Example:  *"Be a voter in this election.  Skip the line and _vote early_!"*
* Ask people to **vote on Election Day, 11/8**
    * Can your product make planning a voter's trip easier?  People need to find their polling place, get there, and cast their vote.
    * Example: *"Everyone's heading to the polls! _Join them_ and be a voter in this election."*
* Ask people to **get their friends and family to vote.**  People are more likely to vote (https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/research-backed-ways-get-out-vote) when others are voting and they expect to be held accountable for voting.
