## Vote on Election Day, 11/8 
{: .playbook-action }

* __Successful calls to action__ emphasize the large expected turnout and the person's desire to be a voter. Example: "Everyone's heading to the polls! Join them and be a voter in this election." 
* Consider how your product can __make the process of voting easier__, especially encouraging early planning.  People will need to find their polling place, get there, and cast their vote. 
* Note: polling place locations will be released in late October.  We'll publish a link here to the complete list when it's released.
