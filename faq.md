## What is [techthevote.org](http://techthevote.org/) about?
{: .question #what-is-techthevote-about}

We're a non-partisan, grassroots group of professionals from across the tech industry. We're focused on creating more civic engagement in the tech industry, including driving voter turnout through our products. **We don't care who people vote for - we just want more people to vote**.  And since people use our products every day, simple integrations can have an impact.

---

## What kind of impact can I realistically have?
{: .question }

Every vote counts. The products we build are used by people every day.  Even a few hours of work can have an impact.

A turnkey messaging prompt to friends and family, a simple request to confirm voter registration, or a carpooling suggestion to get to the polls can help make it easier for people to vote.

---

## Why does getting out the vote matter?
{: .question }

Elections are frequently won by small margins, so every vote counts.  In almost all states, when a candidate wins by even a slim margin, all the Electoral College votes for the state are tallied to that candidate. For example, [state results from 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012#Results_by_state'){:target="_blank"} show President Obama won Ohio by an average of only 9 votes per precinct and Florida by an average of 6 votes per precinct.

## How can I design a good implementation without investing much time?
{: .question }

A few questions can help kick this off.

* **How does the voting process complement how people use your product?** For example, people will need to find the closest polling place, drive or carpool with friends, and discuss voting recommendations.  Are there easy tie-ins with your product?
* **How can getting out the vote help you meet your product goals?** For example, if you're encouraging people to share their location in your app, providing the closest polling location could drive turnout and your product goals.
* **Prioritize battleground states if you can't ship something nationally**. Both parties are focused on these states, in descending size of Electoral College votes: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa.
* And of course, our __Turnkey Suggestions__ take <1 day of work.

## Who can participate?
{: .question }

Any company can participate, in any way that's right for you. People use our products every day.  We can make a real difference in broad civic participation. 

Some leaders like [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/press/news/honoring-the-voting-rights-act){:target="_blank"} and [Google](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/07/a-voice-for-everyone-in-2016.html){:target="_blank"} have already publicly discussed how they're supporting voter turnout.
