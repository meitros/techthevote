### What is [TechTheVote.org](http://techthevote.org/) about?
{: .question #what-is-techthevote-about}

We're a non-partisan, grassroots group of professionals from across the tech industry. We're focused on helping the tech industry be more civic-minded and drive voter turnout through our products. **We don't care who people vote for - we just want more people to vote.** And since people use our products every day, simple integrations can have an impact.


---

### What kind of impact can I realistically have?
{: .question }

Every vote counts. The products we build are used by people every day. Even a few hours of work can have an impact.

A simple messaging prompt to friends and family, a request to confirm voter registration, or a carpooling suggestion to get to the polls can make it easier for people to vote.

---

### Why does getting out the vote matter?
{: .question }

Elections are frequently won by small margins, so every vote counts. In almost all states, when a candidate wins by even a slim margin, all the Electoral College votes for the state are tallied to that candidate. For example, [state results from 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012#Results_by_state'){:target="_blank"} show President Barack Obama won Ohio over Mitt Romney by an average of only 9 votes per precinct and Florida by an average of 6 votes per precinct.

---

### How can I design a good implementation without investing much time?
{: .question }

A few questions can help kick this off.

* **How does the voting process complement how people use your product?** For example, people will need to find the closest polling place, drive or carpool with friends, and discuss voting recommendations. Are there easy tie-ins with your product?
* **How can getting out the vote help you meet your product goals?** For example, if you're encouraging people to share their location in your app, providing the closest polling location could drive turnout and your product goals.
* **Prioritize battleground states if you can't ship something nationally**. Both parties are focused on these states, in descending size of Electoral College votes: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa.
* And of course, our <a href="./playbook#simple-ideas" class="nav-element">_Simple Ideas_</a> take less than one day of work.

### Who can participate?
{: .question }

Any company can participate, in any way that's right for you. People use our products every day. We can make a real difference in broad civic participation. 

Some leaders like [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/press/news/honoring-the-voting-rights-act){:target="_blank"} and [Google](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/07/a-voice-for-everyone-in-2016.html){:target="_blank"} have already publicly discussed how they're supporting voter turnout.

---

### Can anyone use the banners you provide?
{: .question }

### How do I learn more or get more help?
{: .question }

Reach out to us at [info@techthevote.org](mailto:info@techthevote.org) or join us on Slack (see how on our <a href="./resources" class="nav-element">Resources</a> page) to chat with PMs, designers and engineers interested in helping you brainstorm product ideas and answer implementation questions.

---

### What are the key election milestones and deadlines by state?
{: .question }

The full calendar of state registration and early vote deadlines is in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWwgneNFajwDlFx91SLCHUxUJOSO7lR0G5zUWFK0YY4/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" class="inline_link">Google's Civic Information spreadsheet</a>. You can request access by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5hF4w1LuO_d4KSlbX1aGtv67XasNjhJc73QbWlkrYVldX_Q/viewform){:target="_blank"}.

Our recommendation for what to focus on and when:

* now - 10/15:  focus on voter registration
* 10/16 - 11/7:  focus on early voting, both by mail and in-person
* 11/8:  focus on Election Day voting

---

### Why does early voting matter?
{: .question }

Analysts expect 35-40% of ballots will likely be cast early this election.  In 2012, [32% of ballots nationwide](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-p-mcdonald/a-modest-early-voting-ris_b_3430379.html){:target="_blank"} were cast early.  In 2014, [60% of California ballots](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/historical-absentee/){:target="_blank"} were early. Note there is early in-person voting (which doesnâ€™t usually require extra steps beyond registration) and absentee or mail-in voting (which typically has additional requirements).

---

### Can I add promotions or incentives to get people to vote or register their friends?
{: .question }

No. You can't offer anything in return for registering, voting, or getting others to register or vote. Consult your friendly lawyer for more details.

---

### Who should I target with my messaging?
{: .question }

Eligible voters are over 18 on Election Day, so they're born on or before November 8, 1998. Turnout patterns have historically varied by demographic. Young people and minority groups have historically had lower registration and turnout rates. What messaging makes sense for your specific audience?

### What gets people to vote?
{: .question }

Check out <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/research-backed-ways-get-out-vote" target="_blank" class="inline-link">some research</a> on the subject.  We've included a summary in our <a href="./playbook" class="nav-element">Playbook</a> as well.
