What kind of impact can I realistically have?
{: .question }

Every vote counts. The products we build are used by people every day.  Even a few hours of work can have an impact.

A turnkey messaging prompt to friends and family, a simple request to confirm voter registration, or a carpooling suggestion to get to the polls can help make it easier for people to vote.

Why does getting out the vote matter?

Elections are frequently won by small margins, so every vote counts.  In almost all states, when a candidate wins by even a slim margin, all the Electoral College votes for the state are tallied to that candidate. For example, state results from 2012 show President Obama won Ohio by an average of only 9 votes per precinct and Florida by an average of 6 votes per precinct.

How can I design a good implementation without investing much time?

A few questions can help kick this off.

* How does the voting process complement how people use your product?
  * For example, people will need to find the closest polling place, drive or carpool with friends, and discuss voting recommendations.  Are there easy tie-ins with your product?
* How can getting out the vote help you meet your product goals?
  * For example, if you're encouraging people to share their location in your app, providing the closest polling location could drive turnout and your product goals.

* Prioritize battleground states if you can't ship something nationally

  * Both parties are focused on these states, in descending size of Electoral College votes: Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa.

* And of course, our Turnkey Suggestions take <1 day of work.
