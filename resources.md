</div>

TurboVote, an application of the group [Democracy Works](http://democracy.works), helps people register to vote through their website. They've primarily partnered with colleges, universities, and civic organizations, and they're available in both English and Spanish. <br>

To use them you can simply direct people to their website, or partner with them more closely by using their contact form. The process to register is straightforward, and if their state has an online voter registration system it offers to redirect them there. After users go through the process, they can also receive updates about future elections. Users can't easily check if they have already registered though.
