Install gems (we install gems locally)

  bundle install --path vendor

Run site on dev server. We used the system version of ruby on os x 10.11 (>2.)

  bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

  (if this doesn't work for you for some reason, check out _config.yml and see
  if there's something there you should tweak)
