    which gives people in-depth, state-by-state guides on voter registration and how to vote.
    These features, which are available in both English and Spanish, provide information on everything from how 
    to register online or in person to ID requirements, key deadlines, and when and where you can vote early. 
    Google also launched support in Search for

    which helps people find their polling place location and voting ID requirements.

    In this third year of participation, Tumblr linked logged-in users in the US directly 
    to the National Voter Registration Day's registration landing page via a prominent 
    button in the right rail of the Tumblr dashboard and via an animated post on the 
    Tumblr Staff blog which was promoted in their feed. 
    To extend their impact on voter turnout, this year Tumblr added a new feature to 
    give blog owners the option to adopt an interstitial so that all of their web 
    visitors would be encouraged to go register as well -- nearly 175,000 blogs opted in.
